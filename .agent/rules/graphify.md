## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:
- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- Use CLI commands for cross-module questions: `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`, or `graphify explain "<concept>"` — prefer these over grep for cross-module questions
- After modifying code files in this session, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost)
